# Contributing to SpooVault

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SpooVault! This project is a **multi-chain encrypted document vault** supporting both **Avalanche (EVM)** and **Stellar (Soroban)** networks. We participate in open-source campaigns on Grantfox.

---

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts for Avalanche EVM.
- `contracts-stellar/`: Rust smart contracts for Stellar Soroban.
- `src/`: React + Vite frontend application.
  - `src/context/Web3Context.tsx`: Manages multi-chain connections (Metamask for Avalanche, Freighter for Stellar).
  - `src/services/contract.service.ts`: Client service wrapper routing calls to either network.
  - `src/services/stellar.service.ts`: Stellar/Freighter wallet integration service.
  - `src/services/ipfs.service.ts` & `src/services/keyInbox.service.ts`: IPFS storage services (supports proxy configuration).

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher) and **npm**
2. **Rust** and **Cargo** (for Stellar/Soroban contracts)
3. **Soroban CLI** (optional, for deploying Soroban contracts locally):
   ```bash
   cargo install --locked soroban-cli
   ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

## Developing Smart Contracts

### 1. Avalanche (Solidity + Hardhat)

- Compile contracts:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```
- Deploy to Avalanche Fuji testnet:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy:contract
  ```

### 2. Stellar (Rust + Soroban)

- Navigate to the contract folder:
  ```bash
  cd contracts-stellar
  ```
- Build the contract to WASM:
  ```bash
  cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
  ```
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  cargo test
  ```

## Developing the Frontend

1. Start the React/Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Start the local Pinata proxy (optional, for testing IPFS uploads without exposing keys):
   ```bash
   npm run proxy:pinata
   ```
3. Use the network switcher in the header sidebar to toggle between Avalanche (MetaMask) and Stellar (Freighter).

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Pick an Issue**: Search the GitHub issues list for items marked `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
2. **Branch Naming**: Create a feature branch named `feature/issue-<number>-description` or `bugfix/issue-<number>-description`.
3. **Write Tests**: If you are changing smart contract logic, ensure tests are updated or added.
4. **Code Styling**: Format your code before submitting a Pull Request.
5. **Submit PR**: Describe your changes in detail and link to the issue you are fixing.
